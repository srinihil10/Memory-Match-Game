2. **Objective**: Match all pairs of cards with the same icon.
3. Players can flip over **two cards at a time** by clicking on them:
   - If the two cards match, they remain flipped over and disappear from the board.
   - If the two cards do not match, they flip back face-down after a short delay.
4. The game ends when all pairs have been matched.
5. Enjoy testing your memory skills and have fun!
